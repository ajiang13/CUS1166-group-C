Deliverable for sprint 2a for John
https://github.com/ajiang13/CUS1166-group-C/releases/tag/v0.2-sprint2a-hoey

Documentation is on Github in /documentation/sprint2

Note: we need to work on merging John's work (filtering) into the master branch as it's not compatible with the changes made for advanced search as-is. See first release for other 3 use cases. We will be changing the implementation to make it work; the second release is just evidence of John's work (some functioning filtering).

Tasks:

Alan:
Fixed issues from sprint 1 (search based on specific fields).
Added form and methods for advanced search (has display error)

John:
Added ability to sort search results. Certain filters have errors.

Matt:
Added view for displaying detailed restaurant info.

Raeven:
Added login page and ability to log in (only as admin currently). Will add functionality to store and authenticate users.
